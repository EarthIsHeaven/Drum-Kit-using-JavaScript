# Drum-Kit-using-JavaScript

The drum kit project enables users to play drum sounds by clicking on buttons or pressing specific keys. Clicking on drum buttons triggers both sound and animation effects. Likewise, pressing corresponding keys on the keyboard produces the same drum sounds and animations. This interactive experience mimics playing drums and offers an enjoyable way to create rhythm and sound.
